## Troubleshooting

**Can't see edit buttons?**
- Make sure you're logged in as admin (see login steps above)
- Try refreshing the page

**Changes not saving?**

- Try again - there's error handling built in

**Logged out accidentally?**
- Just repeat the login process on the RSVP page

## Adding New Editable Sections

If you want to make other text editable (like more story paragraphs), let Skyler know which specific text you'd like to be able to edit, and he can add more edit buttons for you.

The system is designed to be simple and safe - you can't break anything by editing text content!
